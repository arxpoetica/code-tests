# Map Search Test

## Base Files

You've been given:

1. `index.html`: The base HTML file with a full-page Google map with inline javascript & css
2. `sample-data.js`: The sample data that should be searched. Each record has _at least_ an `id` and `name`.

## The Task

Create a user interface that allows an end user to search through the provided sample data (found in `sample-data.js`) for results based on their `name`. When finding a search result, the end user should be able to select that result and have it's location displayed on the map. When clicking that map marker, you should display a modal (popup) that contains additional information about that location.  

## Things to think about

- What kinds of libraries do you intend to use (or not use) and why?
- How friendly is the user experience? _Feel free to look around at other map search implementations on the web and see if you notice any things that stick out as really enhancing the UX._


## Extra Credit

1. We use [Ractive.js](http://ractive.js.org) for our user interface at **Ground Signal**. If you find it useful for this exercise, by all means give it a go!
2. We also implement _lots_ of charts using [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org/). We've included some data (see `avgStoreTraffic`) in the `sample-data.js` in case you want to spice up your modal with that.
3. Anything else :)
